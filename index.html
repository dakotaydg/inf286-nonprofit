				<h1>About Rosemary's Babies</h1>
				<h3>Rosemary's Babies Company was birthed by founder Rosemary Oglesby-Henry. Rosemary used her life experiences as a teen parent, education in leadership, and personal trauma to create a resource for teen parents.<br  /><br  />In 2013, after realizing that in the years it took her child to grow up, teen parents were still facing many of the obstacles she faced when she was a young parent in their position. She knew a solution to this problem would be to provide resources, education, and life skills to teen parents firsthand as she had done with family and friends. With the goal being to provide help in navigating the difficulties of teen parenthood from a generational perspective, she began building on this dream deferred.<br  /><br  />Eight years after conception, Rosemaryâ€™s Babies Company is growing. In the first years of our existence, RBC has aided hundreds of teens through hotline services, emergency care, and programs aimed at helping teen parents build their legacy. Rosemaryâ€™s Babies Co. exists to model a path to success for teen parenthood.</h3>
